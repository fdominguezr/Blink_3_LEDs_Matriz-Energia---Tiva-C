# Blink_3_LEDs_Matriz-Energia---Tiva-C
Test on Blinking the 3 onboard LEDs in a [Tiva C with Energia](http://energia.nu/pin-maps/guide_tm4c123launchpad/)
For general information about Tiva C and my projects arount see [my projects as Francisco Dominguez at Let's make robots](http://letsmakerobots.com/user/21415/pages)

What it does?
  * This program is a modification on the blink demo program at [Energia files](http://energia.nu/)
  * It includes the three LEDs onboard: red, green and blue
  * It also switches each on and off alternatively
  * Time on and time off can be configured to manage the power of total light
  * Extra tip: if timming is too fast resultant color is white!
